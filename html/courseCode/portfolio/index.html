                    <p>

                        University of Nottingham to finish my degree in Computer
                        Science.

                    <p>
                        I love to play football! I used to play for a youth team before
                        going to University, where I now participate in 7 aside football
                        matches weekly.

                        I learned karate for several years growing up as a kid and though
                        I take an interest, I do not participate in any clubs or teams at 
                        the moment.
